  <h1>
    F up one, you lose all three.
  </h1>
  <!-- not actually like that-->
  <!--It just hurts to see people you've done so much for, love you the same as someone that has hurt them.-->
  <!--And it hurts even more realising you cannot take back whatever you already gave them.-->
  <!--If you realy love them you gotta stop giving them more and more so they learn to appreciate what they have, but you are affraid that they will leave you because they'll think you do not have anything to give them anything .-->
  <!--While in reality you don't want to give all the stars from the night sky to somebody that will not appreciate it.-->
  <!--You do not want to run out of things to give to people that require even more and that are unsatisfied with what you already gave them.-->
  <!--You do not know if they will appreciate it because of the assumption you made.Which may be true, but you don't really know, don't really care.-->
  <!--You're too scared to do anything cause you don't want to lose them, nor want them to be unsatisfied with everything they got from you.-->
  <!--You can't change the world little Jeffrey. You can't change the people big Max. All you can do is give them everything you have so you don't leave without giving anything to those you love.-->
  <!--You can only change them once you stop feeding them and them knowing you can't do otherwise.Which cannot be as long as you're alive.-->
  <!--Is the way I feel selfish? Is the way I see things wrong? I don't really know.-->
  <!--All I know is that I know nothing.-->
